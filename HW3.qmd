## Task 1

### Part A

The `read_csv` function is a specific use-case of the `read_delim` function that specifies that the delimiter must be a comma (`,`). The data that we're trying to read in here is delimited by semi-colons (`;`) so we cannot use the `read_csv` function as a result. The help file `?read_csv` specifies that `read_csv2` supports semi-colons (`;`) so we can use that function instead.

```{r}
#Read in and display data.txt
data <- read_csv2(".\\data\\data.txt", col_names = TRUE, 
                  show_col_types = FALSE)
data
```

### Part B

```{r}
#Read in and display data2.txt
data2 <- read_delim(".\\data\\data2.txt", col_names = TRUE, 
                    col_types = "fdc", delim = '6')
data2
```
